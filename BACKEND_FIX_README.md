# Backend URL Configuration Fix

## Problem
The frontend application was not connecting to the backend at `https://backend-eude1.replit.app/health` despite the URL working when tested manually.

## Root Cause
The application was missing the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable, causing it to default to `http://localhost:5000` instead of the actual backend URL.

## Solution
Created `.env` file with the correct backend URL:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://backend-eude1.replit.app
```

## Verification
1. **Development Mode**: The console now shows `ðŸ“¡ HEALTH URL â†’ https://backend-eude1.replit.app/health`
2. **Production Build**: The backend URL is properly embedded in the built application
3. **Configuration Loading**: Environment variables are correctly processed by Vite

## How to Test
1. Run `npm run dev` - you should see the correct backend URL in the browser console
2. Run `npm run build` - the built application will use the correct backend URL
3. Deploy the application - it will now connect to the working backend

## Files Changed
- **Added**: `.env` - Contains the backend URL configuration

The fix ensures the frontend application correctly points to the working backend instead of trying to connect to localhost.
